How to make Bread
=================

This is summarized from [a more verbose article][1]. Several improvements here:

- They never say how long it takes total. One popular recipe that links to it says 2 hours. It's closer to a week and a half all told, and even the baking part is most of a day.
- Too many words, no clear sections. Important things like the order of the steps are hard to extract.
- List of ingredients is useful.

Time required
-------------

- **8 Days** for the starter
- **5 hours** for the sponge

Making Sponge
-------------

- **Mix** 750 ml flour and 250 ml water with starter
- **Rest** for 2 - 8 hours

Post sponge
-----------

- **Mix** in salt and flour until you can't stir it no mo
- **Knead** for about 3 minutes
- **Rest** for 5 minutes (good time to clean out the bowel)
- **Knead** for several more minutes
- **Transfer:** to a greased bowl
   - **Flip** once
- **Rest** for rise for 1.5 - 2 hours
- **Divide** in half and shape
- **Transfer** to cooking pan (covered with cornmeal if you got it)
- **Rest** for about 2 hours
- **Decorate** with slices and cuts
- **Bake** at 235 for 20 minutes


To do
=====

- Consider this [this NYT article][2] more carefully. Specifically:
   - Add _autolyse_ to the sponge by mixing the flour and water in a
     4:3 ratio and waiting for 30 minutes. This is supposed to start
     the gluten separation.
   - They recommend kneading a lot longer, around 20 minutes total,
     until stretching it into a thin layer forms a translucent
     "window".
   - Less kneading, more "folding" in their language, all done in a
     bowel, with what seems to be wetter dough.
