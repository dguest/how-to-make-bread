How to make Bread
=================

This is summarized from [a more verbose article][1]. Several improvements here:

- Time required is important. People have jobs.
- Most articles have many words, no clear sections. Important things like the order of the steps are hard to extract.
- List of ingredients is useful.
- Translate units to SI. Ooohh look at me, I live in Europe.

To do
=====

- Consider this [this NYT article][2] more carefully. Specifically:
   - They recommend kneading a lot longer, around 20 minutes total,
     until stretching it into a thin layer forms a translucent
     "window".
   - Less kneading, more "folding" in their language, all done in a
     bowel, with what seems to be wetter dough.
   - They recommend using autolyse, see below.

- Add [_autolyse_][3] to the sponge by mixing the flour and water in a
  4:3 ratio and waiting for 30 minutes. This is supposed to start the
  gluten separation.
